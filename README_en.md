## Who I'm

I'm Brazilian, electronic technician since 2011, I love the area since long before that, I'm self-taught and I usually learn things on my own, with that I've learned from creation and development of Printed Circuit Boards to recording and editing videos and audios, among other things.

Together with my friends Roger Marinque and Guilherme Andrade, We are create the podcast Volt Ampere about technical electronics matters, which you can access [here](https://voltamperepod.com/), where we try to give back a little of everything we learned with the community.

I'm passionate about the maker and opensource world since 2004 when I first had contact with the GNU/Linux community.

My English learning was almost entirely self-taught, I spent very little time in language schools, but most of it was via Duolingo, Videos, Reading electronics article.


## Languages

* Portuguese - Native

## Wish

I want to give back to the community a little of everything I've learned, a point that I think is important is that my projects have always been formatted in Portuguese, but I will always try to translate them into English and Spanish, making the projects more accessible to the international community.
